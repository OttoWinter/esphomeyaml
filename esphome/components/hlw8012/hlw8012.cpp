The HLW8012 is supposed to have a 50% duty-cycle on its CF and CF1 pins but
this has been observed to not be the case.  Some hardware showed square waves
very close to this but other hardware had 99+% "low" with only brief spikes
"high" before going back.

If the duty cycle is not exactly 50% then the it is not possible to tune all
three outputs (voltage, current, and power) from two resistor values.  As the
duty-cycle approaches 100%, resistor values that give accurate voltage and
current result in 2x power being reported.

Experiments done using the width of the "low" portion, the apparently stable
portion, of the wave yielded a correct power measurement but voltage and
current each about 1/2 what they should be.  Adjusting resistor values to fix
voltage and current resulted in power measurements 4x what it should have been.

Correct results for all three (V, I, and P) could possibly be achieved by doing
pulse counting for CF1 (voltage and current) but pulse width measuring for CF
(power).  However, it seems wrong to have two separate measurement techniques
for outputs that are supposed to function the same way.

Also, pulse width measurement has a problem when the entity being measured
goes to zero.  In that case, the pulse width should be infinite making it
technically impossible to measure.  In practice, the reported last-width is
always the last non-zero measurement.  This can be the previous value before
it went to zero or it could be a signal glitch that erroneously triggered an
interrupt, resulting in completely random timing.  The former is wrong but
the latter is just plain bad.  As such, pulse width measuring is a dangerous
choice.

Using pulse counting, accurate voltage and current measuring can be achieved
by tuning the two resistor parameters.  But if the hardware is non-ideal
(i.e. non 50% duty-cycle) then an additional "linear filter" will have to be
added to the power sensor in order to compensate there.
